    <p>“The owl of Minerva spreads its wings only with the falling dusk”, states Hegel in reference to the reality that historical events are often only understood after their effects have come to be. Not to be confused with a reason for apathy or inaction, this principle is paralleled in how we humans understand our ideological and artistic traditions. The canons we construct for these disciplines are a clear example of how contingencies shape what we see as significant or noteworthy. ‘Apocryphal’ texts can be defined in a few ways, but usually reference something outside the traditional canon or considered at least by some to be heretical. Since, in my opinion, heresy is often simply a synonym for questions that need to be asked or statements that need to be made, I thought ‘Apocrypha’ would be a fitting choice for this collection of pieces I chose to record. Each piece falls, in its own way, outside the usual or typical canon of ‘classical guitar music’ (however you define that), and is an exploration of a side perhaps missing from the usual picture people have of this ‘genre’. Some of the works are new pieces that expand the repertoire or canon in new directions, some are new works which take inspiration from the language of past composers who never wrote for guitar, while others are works that are simply underplayed or underappreciated. I am running out of space here to deliver a sermon on each piece, and I want to save some trees, so please scan the QR code or go to www.michaelibsen.com to find downloadable liner notes if your curiosity has been piqued ;) happy listening!

    <p>I’d like to thank the Canada Council of the Arts for their generous financial support of the album. I’d also like to thank my wife Jessica, my cats Loki and Nayru, and my many friends and family around the world who have encouraged and supported me. A special thanks to the composers, teachers, and musical collaborators I have been honoured to work with and who have contributed to this album including Nathan Bredeson, Zaki Hagins, Jason Noble, Tova Kardonne, Carlo Marchione, Alfredo Santa Ana, Bryan Johanson, and Tilman Hoppstock.
